# Shopping List App

Live: [https://asjadjawed.github.io/shopping-list/](https://asjadjawed.github.io/shopping-list/)

Completely front-end app that uses Javascript OOP to create a shopping list. It stores and loads the list from browser's localStorage.
This means you won't loose your list if you close the app.

Also included in main2.js a simpler version of the app without storage.

Uses:

- HTML5
- Google Fonts
- CSS - Flexbox
- JS
- localStorage (Web Storage API)
